This project explores the effectiveness of machine learning in the detection of fake news articles. Using the ISOT dataset which contains real and fake news articles, a range of data pre-processing steps were applied along with feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorisation. Hyperparameter tuning was performed using Grid search with cross-validation for the machine learning models – Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Random Forest and Linear Support Vector machine, to find the best model settings on which they were then trained. A final evaluation was carried out on an unseen test set to assess the performance of all models using standard metrics including accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. Results show Linear SVM outperformed all other models achieving a test accuracy of 98.52% and score of 0.99 across all other metrics. This was followed closely by Random forest with 96.92%, Logistic Regression with 96.14% and then Multinomial Naïve Bayes with 93.18%.
